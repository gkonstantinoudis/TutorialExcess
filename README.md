## Estimating and visualising excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic with R-INLA and R-shiny

This repository includes all files to download and perform Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal models to estimate excess mortality during the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The 1-3 files are data wrangling files to harmonise and prepare to merge with the mortality data. They can run independently. The 4th file is the population interpolation that requires file 3 to run. The 5th file cleans the mortality data and brings all the different elements together, and the 6th file runs the analysis and extracts the number of predicted deaths had the pandemic not occured per week, age, sex and small area. The raw files to run the analysis can be also found [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/s/5di16s2ybnpfcltnfcl5en2rom5fj5vd), with a folder called Output which contains all the code-based results (cleaned files and model output).
